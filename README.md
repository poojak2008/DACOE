In this dataset we will be importing a dataset from super store where we will be analyzing and visualizing it by plotting charts, cleaning data and performing exploratorary data analysis (EDA) on it. Where will use some of python's powerful and great libraries like Numpy, Pandas etc. And by using all these, we will try to answer some of intresting questions like which category made the highest sale? Contribution of each segment in total sales? Which mode of shipping was preferred most etc. Time series analysis deals with time series based data to extract patterns for predictions and other characteristics of the data. It uses a model for forecasting future values in a small time frame based on previous observations. It is widely used for non-stationary data, such as economic data, weather data, stock prices, and retail sales forecasting.
